\section{Introduction}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Coming up next, we
present the state of the art in parameter setting of simulated
worlds. The next section \ref{sec:met} will present the methodology,
followed by the experimental setup in Section \ref{sec:exp}, whose results will be shown in Section \ref{sec:res}. Finally, we will
present our conclusions to finish the paper.
