Leveraging the power of all devices connected to the Internet for
distributed evolutionary algorithms requires using ubiquituous
platforms such as JavaScript on the browser. However, these platform
are heterogenous and ephemeral, which beg for a change in the canonical
evolutionary algorithm to architectures based in concepts such as a
population pool. In this paper we will test NodIO in a distributed
computing setup; first we will establish how the base pool-based algorithm itself
behaves and how it scales for different nodes; then we will test in in
a real volunteer computing environment in different circumstances to
assess what is the configuration that is able to behave the best from
the point of view of the performance.

\section{Introduction}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Coming up next, we
present the state of the art in parameter setting of simulated
worlds. The next section \ref{sec:met} will present the methodology,
followed by the experimental setup in Section \ref{sec:exp}, whose results will be shown in Section \ref{sec:res}. Finally, we will
present our conclusions to finish the paper.

\section{State of the Art}
\label{sec:sota}

In the last few years, the scenario of distributed computing has
evolved from rigid, synchronous and static setups to fluid, asynchronous and dynamic ones, as
shown in \cite{gong2015distributed}. Besides the well known and tested
master-slave and island models, new models such as the pool-based
evolutionary algorithms
\cite{roy2009distributed,bollini1999distributed,sofea:evopar2012,sofea:naco}
have arisen and been used in volunteer computing experiments
\cite{daniel:euromicro09,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-0801-1210,DBLP:journals/gpem/LaredoBGVAGF14}. As
this last paper shows, designing robust algorithms is an issue, but
predicting the performance is also a big challenge.

This performance has two components. The first is the algorithmic
performance: how many fitness evaluations are needed to reach the
solution. Since the scenario is dynamic and asynchronous it is first
complicated to design an experiment that covers a wide range of
possible situations, although some attempts have been made changing
the population structure \cie{DBLP:conf/lion/LaredoGFMACG11},
migration schemes \cite{hijaze2014investigating} or sampling
strategies \cite{nogueras2015self}.
